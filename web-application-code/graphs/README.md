Contains the navigation graphs in dot format for the subject systems.

For each application there is one file named `<application_name>.txt` indicating the navigation graph extracted when the POs for the subject application are created manually.

Navigation graphs are used during test generation. Test sequences are created by traversing the graphs where each edge is a PO method and each node is a PO.
